# basic

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

Roadmap:

Just finished reading 'Fire in the Valley' and it piqued my interest in retro computers and programing languages.

I am not positive I will ever get to this project, but my plan it to implement the BASIC programing language in either x86 or maybe C++ if I find assembly language is too time consuming.
